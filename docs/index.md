## Description
Machine reading comprehension (MRC), a task which asks machine to read a given context then answer questions based on its understanding, is considered one of the key problems in artificial intelligence and has significant interest from both academic and industry. Over the past few years, great progress has been made in this field, thanks to various end-to-end trained neural models and high quality datasets with large amount of examples proposed.

## DataSet
* [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowd-workers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
* [CoQA](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/) a large-scale dataset for building Conversational Question Answering systems. The goal of the CoQA challenge is to measure the ability of machines to understand a text passage and answer a series of interconnected questions that appear in a conversation. CoQA is pronounced as coca
* [QuAC](https://quac.ai/) is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and participating in information seeking dialog. QuAC introduces challenges not found in existing machine comprehension datasets: its questions are often more open-ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context.
